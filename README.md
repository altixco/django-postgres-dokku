### How to install the template ###

Clone the repository, and update your origin url: 
```
git clone https://github.com/altixco/django-postgres-dokku project_name
cd project_name
```

Merge the addons required by your project (Optional):
```
git merge origin/rest
git merge origin/webpack
git merge origin/push-notifications
```

Rename your project files and directorys:
```
make name=project_name init
```
> Info: Make is required, for mac run `brew install make`

> After this command you can already delete the init command inside the `Makefile` 

The command before will remove the `.git` folder so you will have to initialize it again:
```
git init
git remote add origin <repository-url>
```

### How to run the project ###

The project use docker, so just run:

```
docker-compose up
```

> If it's first time, the images will be created. Sometimes the project doesn't run at first time because the init of postgres, just run again `docker-compose up` and it will work.

*Your app will run in url `localhost:8000`*

To recreate the docker images after dependencies changes run:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

To remove the docker containers including database (Useful sometimes when dealing with migrations):

```
docker-compose down
```

### Accessing Administration

The django admin site of the project can be accessed at `localhost:8000/admin`

By default the development configuration creates a superuser with the following credentials:

```
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

## Production Deployment: ##

The project is dokku ready, this are the steps to deploy it in your dokku server:

#### Server Side: ####

> This docs does not cover dokku setup, you should already have configured the initial dokku config including ssh keys

Create app and configure postgres:
```
dokku apps:create project_name
dokku postgres:create project_name
dokku postgres:link project_name project_name
```

> If you don't have dokku postgres installed, run this before:
> `sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres.git`

Create the required environment variables:
```
dokku config:set project_name ENVIRONMENT=production DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=....
```

Current required environment variables are:

* ENVIRONMENT
* DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
* EMAIL_PASSWORD

Use the same command to configure secret credentials for the app

#### Local Side: ####

Configure the dokku remote:

```
git remote add production dokku@<my-dokku-server.com>:project_name
```

Push your changes and just wait for the magic to happens :D:

```
git push production master
```

Optional: To add SSL to the app check:
https://github.com/dokku/dokku-letsencrypt

Optional: Additional nginx configuration (like client_max_body_size) should be placed server side in:
```
/home/dokku/<app>/nginx.conf.d/<app>.conf
```

> Further dokku configuration can be found here: http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/
