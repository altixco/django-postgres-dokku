// Bootstrap and other libraries should be imported in vendor.scss in order to create a different chunk for caching purposes
// If we import bootstrap here as well we would have duplicated css increasing the page loading time,
// however, the variables scss is shared between the app and the libraries, therefore, you can use it to override variables like:
// bootstrap $primary, $secondary, $grid-gutter-width, etc.
@import "variables";

// Imports required to use bootstrap variables that are not overridden by _variables.scss
